Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

This repository contains the raw dataset for a diagnostic breast cancer analysis from Wisconsin. The files include data analysis to determine which tumor factors are associated with benign and malignant tumors. There are 10 features associated with breast cancer tumors included in the dataset, they are each measured 3 different ways. They are measured by the mean, maximum, and standard error. A regression tree, PCA, screeplot, and importance chart were used to answer question 1. They allowed us to see which features were major predictors for whether the breast cancer tumor is benign or malignant. RDA, LDA, RF, ROC, and SVM models were used to answer question 2. These allowed us to visualize whether or not the main predictors determined in question 1 could accurately predict whether a tumor is cancerous or not.

The questions which are being answered are 
(1) Which features are most correlated with a benign/malignant tumor? 
(2) Can we predict whether a sample is benign or cancerous?
